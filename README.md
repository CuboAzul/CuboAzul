# Welcome to City 17.

Hi, I'm eros71, also known as eros744, I usually work on HTML and CSS related stuff.
Right now I work on the sm64js site, and excepcionally, in the game itself too and I'm learning some Java and SQL basics.

I usually work on Mario related projects, but also some web stuff. Even though I know a little Java, I really don't like it at all.
